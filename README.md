## Transparency and Open Data Portals of Brazilian states and municipalities

Obtaining a list of transparency and open data portals of all of the 27
Brazilian states and 5,570 municipalities can be a daunting task. This
project has the goal of consolidating and keeping up to date all of that
reference information.

This repository contains spreadsheets obtained from several public data
sources and then validated:

* [tables 31 and 32](sources/research/klein-2017) from the PhD thesis of Rodrigo Klein (2017)/tede/7724)
* [DBPedia](sources/dbpedia)

The objective is to collaborate on the monitoring of transparency of Brazilian
states and municipalities in projects such as
[Colaboradados](http://colaboradados.github.io/) and the [list of open data
catalogs in Brazil](https://github.com/dadosgovbr/catalogos-dados-brasil).

Where we noticed a change in the portals' addresses (URLs) the tables have been
updated.
