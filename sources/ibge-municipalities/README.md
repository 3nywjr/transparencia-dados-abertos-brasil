The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) assigns a unique
numerical code to each Brazilian municipality.

This dataset is available on IBGE's FTP service as
[a zipped up file](ftp://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/organizacao_do_territorio/estrutura_territorial/divisao_territorial/2018/DTB_2018.zip).
Inside the zipped archive, some spreadsheets in Excel and Open Document
formats (named `RELATORIO_DTB_BRASIL_MUNICIPIO.xls` and
`RELATORIO_DTB_BRASIL_MUNICIPIO.ods`) contain all of the codes for Brazilian
states, meso-region, micro-region and municipalities, along with their
respective names.

The IBGE code is useful for merging data from other sources, as it is often
used to uniquely identify municipalities in Brazil.
