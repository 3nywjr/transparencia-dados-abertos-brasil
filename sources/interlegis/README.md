The Interlegis Institute offers assistance to local parliaments in the form
of free and open source software solutions, hosting and other services.

Among the free software offered, there is the *Portal Modelo* which can be
used to set up the municipal chambers' websites. It could therefore be
possible to obtain from Interlegis the list of websites that use
*Portal Modelo* and their respective URLs.

*Sistema de Informações Gerenciais do Interlegis* offers some information on
[a map](https://sigi.interlegis.leg.br/dashboard/mapa/), but the URLs of the
local parliaments are not there.

Information is obtained instead from an older version of
[a wiki page](https://colab.interlegis.leg.br/wiki/CasasUsamPortalModelo?version=414#L1).
The current version of the page is defaced, so this is probably outdated, but
it's all that's available.
